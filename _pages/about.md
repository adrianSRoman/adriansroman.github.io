I am an Audio Software Engineer at Tesla and an M.S. student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My research focuses on developing explainable AI algorithms for multi-modal machine perception, with a particular emphasis on building auditory models to detect and localize sound events. I believe machine listening can significantly enhance the capabilities of intelligent systems, driving innovation in areas like Robotics, autonoumous vehicles, and beyond.
